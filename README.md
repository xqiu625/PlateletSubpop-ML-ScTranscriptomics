•	The platelet to T cell ratio proportion in PBMC was identified as the most potent predictor for distinguishing survivors from fatal patients, underscores the potential of this ratio as a prognostic biomarker.

•	The discovery of different platelet subgroups, especially active coagulation, hypoxic, and quiescent clusters, in fatal COVID-19 patients, indicates potential targeted treatment strategies.

•	In patients with severe and fatal conditions, we observed three key phenomena: the aggregation of platelets with monocytes, the amplification of endothelial dysfunction by platelets, and a decrease in lymphocyte activation and differentiation due to platelets.
